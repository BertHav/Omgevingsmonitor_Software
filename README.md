This release makes it possible to operate the Omgevings Monitor (OM) independently of USB power for a longer period >> days. Needless to write, this depends on the ambient temperature and the amount of daylight that the solar panel receives. 

It is possible to use the OM as a handheld by using the BOOT0 button in case of battery operation. The OM then wakes up from energy saving mode. This becomes visible by the lighting of the LEDs. By pressing the user button, the LEDs go out again and the OM starts operating in energy saving mode again. 

If the battery is low, the system will enter a very low energy state and will not operate normal until the battery is charged. By pressing the reset button while charging, the device becomes operational again. 
As long as there is some energy in the battery, it is possible that the device will start up briefly and then go back into battery protection mode.
